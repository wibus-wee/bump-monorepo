## Usage

```bash
$ npm i -g @wibus/bump-monorepo
```

Write your config in `package.json`:

```json5
{
  // ...
  "bump": {
    "message": "release: %s", // commit message
  }
  // ...
}
```

Then run:

```bash
$ bump-monorepo
```

It will use the root `package.json` as the main version. Though you choose to bump a package inside, it will bump the root `package.json` too.

## Warnings

If you config `activePackages` in `package.json`, it will only bump the packages in the array.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "bump": {
    "activePackages": ["packages/a", "packages/b"]
  }
  // ...
}
```

> **warning**: Once you do this, you must continue to use this config. Otherwise, it may damage your repository.
